# 4-to-1-Multiplexer
 This project focuses on making a simple 4 to 1 Multiplexer to get familiar with using Linux, and MobaXterm for writing code in Verilog, setup files, debug, simulate, and generate waveforms.
 
## Description 
 This project is an introductory to MobaXterm. I constructed a 4-input Multiplexer that takes in 4-inputs, has 2 select lines, and 1 output. I then constructed a testbench for the Muliplexer and ran simulation. I saved my simulation results in a Log file which can be found in my simulation folder.
